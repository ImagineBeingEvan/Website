        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            8/20/23 - The first week of Intro to Engineering was kind of fun and I learned a bit. The first day we set tried to set up the websites and AWS, but it had many 
            issues and the source we were using was outdated. We spent about 3 or 4 classes setting up everything and on this day, 8/24/23, we finished setting everything up. 
            The first thing we did was do a group activity of using PVC pipes to try to get a marble into a cup, without the marble moving backwards, and the PVC pipes cant 
            overlap and if the marble touched the ground or we did any of the things we weren't supposed to do, we had to go back to the start. The class was split up into 
            2 groups to do this activity, it was fun even though none of the groups suceeded on getting the marble into the cup. I learned how to set up AWS and github. I 
            also learned how to make a website using different headers, titles etc.

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
            8/31/23 - This week we learned about Mechanical engineering. We took a quiz on it and I believe I did good. We also learned about using TinkerCAD and using
            TinkerCAD I made a model computer, and a rube goldburg machine model. The rube goldburg machine model, we are going to turn it into an actual thing 
            using objects such as cardboard and string.

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>
            This week we started our rube goldburg machines and made them in person. Since we finsihed out tinkercad design of the machine, we were able to start
            making it using materials we were giving. We also had a quiz that I felt like I did good on. We were using exacto knives on the machine and we didnt get
            much done because we didn't have much time to do it. So far all we have done is cut out most of the carboard of the machine used for the skeleton of it.
            We also taped some parts together, such as a leg and a ramp.

        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
            This week we finsihed our rube goldburg machine! We added a couple of unexpected things to it due to the fact that we didn't have enough "aspects" to the build.
            That means we had to have 3 parts, such as what we used, wheel, inclined clope and a lever. For the inclined slope we made a ball roll down it, roll down another one, 
            and run into a car, which is the wheel aspect. Then the car ran down another slope and hit a lever, which on the end of the lever had a needle to pop the balloon which
            was our objective.

        <p>
            This week we worked on 2 engineering challenges. The first of the two challenges we had to create a paper boat using 1 piece of paper and scissors. We had to make it hold
            the most weight, but it had to float on water for 5 minutes. The person who held the most weight and their boat also survived all 5 minutes won the competition. Sadly, you 
            didn't get anything for winning. The second challenge we had to create the letter "E" and write it down on a piece of paper and add demensions to it. We then, mixed around 
            the "E"s and gave it to a random person to recreate. You had to recreate a random "E" that you got and make the exact demensions. The last day of the week we took notes on 
            computer engineering and the components involved with it.

            Week 6
        </h2>
        <p>
            This week we took apart a computer learing the inside of it. I knew a lot of the parts of the computer and it was fairly easy because I already know about computers, 
            but none the less it was still fun. We took apart a school office pc that looked old and had parts that I've never seen or heard of. We had to follow instructions on how to 
            take apart the computer, so we wouldn't break it or loose any parts. When we were done taking the computer apart we had to put it back together. The last thing we did 
            this week was take a test on the computer parts. I feel like I did pretty good on the test not knowing just 1 question.

        <p>
            This week we did a lot about prosthetics and bioengineering. We took a bit of notes about bioengineering and the other units related to it. Also, we worked on a prohect making
            a cardboard prosthetic hand, and our objective was to pick up a empty plastic water bottle. The challenge was kind of hard, but me and my partner were able to manage it and worked 
            through it and completed the project. Lastly, we had to create a prosthetic limb in tinkercad for any animal of our choosing. I chose the human for my naimal and created a prosthetic
            arm. I made it so it would attach to a nub on the shoulder.

            Week 8
        </h2>
        <p>
            This week we learned about aerospace engineering and the mechanics to it. I learned that first, aerospace enginerring is very hard and you need to learn many other things
            to be good at aerospace enginerring. We also designed a bottle airplane/rocket, but I chose the rocket and made it in tinkercad. The rocket is simple and looks like a real rocket.
            The thing we are going to be using the bottle rocket for is a launch. We launch the rocket once we are finished, by using pressure to launch the rocket/ airplane and see who's 
            airplane/rocket goes the farthest.

        <p>
            This week we made bottle rockets. Me and my partner, Noah, made a bottle rocket out of glue, cardboard and coke bottles. Our "rocket" took little time to make, making it in only 
            30 minutes. The rocket had 6 wings, which me and Noah originally thought to add 16 small wings, but settled on 6 big wings. Once we finsihed making it, on Thursday we launched our
            rockets having great success and getting second place. Our rocket did better than I anticipated and I had a lot of fun watching other rockets launch. The rockets used water and pressure
            to launch off. First you would fill the bottle up with some water and pressurize it using something, and all you had to do to launch the rocket is to let go of the pipe pressurizing the 
            bottle allowing it to launch.

            This week we learned the different aspects of environmental engineering and what people do to make the environment cleaner. Also we learned what makes the environment dirty and such. The 
            next day we made a filter to make very dirty water clean. We used a combination of putting cotton balls, rocks, small rocks and sand inside a plastic water bottle to make the water clearer. 
            The first time we put the very dirty water through the filter it cleaned it out a bit. But, the more times we put it through the filter the more clean it became. Despite how many times we 
            put the water through the filter it still was kinda dirty. At the end the water was a piss yeollow color, but not the originla black/ brown color. We could have changed what we put on top 
            of each other to make the water clearer.

             This week we learned about circuits. We learned about reisistors, anodes, canodes and more. We also made a circuit board in tikercad. It was composed of a battery, connecting lines, reisistors
             and LEDS. The topic we are learning about is kind of complicated. Learning how and where to put the parts of a circuit board to make the LED light up is kinda of hard. We also did a worksheet 
             about Electrical engineering. I learned about current, voltage and more in the category of Electrical Engineering.

         <p>
             This week we worked on circuits, building them on a breadboard which is the object that connects the circuits and makes things run. We had to work on 2 different labs, lab 3 and 4. Each lab was 
             a different challenge on what we had to construct on the breadobards using resistors, LEDS and more. For lab 3 we had to make a circuit combination that made the LED turn on, and we also had to 
             make 3 LEDS turn on. For Lab 3, at the end, we had to measure the voltage of the cirucit components and write it down on a piece of paper recording our measurements. After we were done with Lab 3, 
             we moved on to lab 4, which we had to use an arduino board which connected to the breadboard. The arduino board helped the breadboard do stuff it couldn't do on its own. We had to code the arduino 
             board to make 3 LEDS on the breadboard flicker on and off in a certain pattern.

             This week we learned about Business engineering and the aspects to it. Also, on the topic of Business Engineering, we learned what is related to it, what you do as a Business Engineer and how to 
             become a Business Engineer. This week we also started brainstorming a shark tank idea. My group and I came up with an idea of making a self heating jacket that uses water to run it. We are still 
             coming up with how it works completely and how we are going to present it. We also have to find out how much it costs to make, how much we are going to sell it for, and much much more. We are also
             thinking of other ideas to present to the sharks, just incase our self heating jacket doesn't work out.

         <p>
             This week we made a presentation on a item or something that we had to sell to the imaginary shark tank people. We had to pitch them an idea on something that we wanted them to invest in. We had to 
             make slides on how much it costs to make, how much we sell it for, how much we have already sold and how much we made, who are we trying to sell the product to and about the product. Our group decided 
             on making a pot that is able to make multiple different food because in the middle of it there is a divider dividing the different foods you can make. My favorite pitch by a student was a measuring tape 
             thing. I forget what it was called, but the way it worked was that you had 2 pins that you could place anywhere and there was a little device telling you how fare away those pins are, making it a very effective
             measuring tape. It didn't cost much and the way they pitched it was very good. Also I would buy the measuring tape thing anytime because of how useful it is.
