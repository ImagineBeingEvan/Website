        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            8/20/23 - The first week of Intro to Engineering was kind of fun and I learned a bit. The first day we set tried to set up the websites and AWS, but it had many 
            issues and the source we were using was outdated. We spent about 3 or 4 classes setting up everything and on this day, 8/24/23, we finished setting everything up. 
            The first thing we did was do a group activity of using PVC pipes to try to get a marble into a cup, without the marble moving backwards, and the PVC pipes cant 
            overlap and if the marble touched the ground or we did any of the things we weren't supposed to do, we had to go back to the start. The class was split up into 
            2 groups to do this activity, it was fun even though none of the groups suceeded on getting the marble into the cup. I learned how to set up AWS and github. I 
            also learned how to make a website using different headers, titles etc. 
        </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
            8/31/23 - This week we learned about Mechanical engineering. We took a quiz on it and I believe I did good. We also learned about using TinkerCAD and using
            TinkerCAD I made a model computer, and a rube goldburg machine model. The rube goldburg machine model, we are going to turn it into an actual thing 
            using objects such as cardboard and string.
